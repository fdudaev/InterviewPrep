public class numberOfDaysInMonth {

    /**
     * Write a method isLeapYear with a parameter of type int named year.
     * The parameter needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 9999.
     * If the parameter is not in that range return false.
     * Otherwise, if it is in the valid range, calculate if the year is a leap year and return true if it is, otherwise return false.
     * A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is divisible by 400.

     * Write another method getDaysInMonth with two parameters month and year. Both of type int.
     * If parameter month is < 1 or > 12 return -1.
     * If parameter year is < 1 or > 9999 then return -1.
     * This method needs to return the number of days in the month. Be careful about leap years they have 29 days in month 2 (February).
     * You should check if the year is a leap year using the method isLeapYear described above.
     * HINT: Use the switch statement.
     * NOTE: Methods isLeapYear and getDaysInMonth need to be public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
